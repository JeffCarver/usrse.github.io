As the US-RSE organization grows, so do the associated costs with operation.
Running a grassroots community-driven organization takes a massive amount of effort on behalf of the community members who volunteer their time.

Donations to support US-RSE's ongoing [mission]({{ site.baseurl }}/mission/) can be made at the [US-RSE OCF member page](https://opencollective.com/usrse).
Donations are tax deductible as allowed to the full extent of the law and can be made via a number of convenient methods.

## Fundraising Initiatives 

Currently the US-RSE is accepting gifts to develop funds focussed on two areas.  

First, we are raising funds to support general operational expenses. The primary general operational needs we are hoping to support at this stage are modest expenses associated with membership management and enhanced communication amongst members. Other activities are currently all volunteer based. 

Second, we are excited to try and grow a student RSE support fund that can help encourage new students to enter and learn about the RSE field. This fund can be contributed to [__here__](https://opencollective.com/usrse/projects/student-spot-awards).

With the advent of our new logo we are working on soon having a way to offer some fun and exciting branded items that can help strengthen fund raising and spread the US-RSE spirit far and wide. 

We are, of course, very interested and open to hearing comments/feedback and suggestions from the broad US-RSE community on financial strategies for the US-RSE.
