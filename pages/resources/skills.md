The following is a list of skills that an RSE might possess. An RSE typically has experience with a subset of these skills. By no means is this list meant to be understood as what an RSE should know but rather as a list that can be used to create a profile for an RSE or an RSE position by picking relevant skills. This list is also not comprehensive. If you find something is missing, please contact the Training and Education Working Group.
