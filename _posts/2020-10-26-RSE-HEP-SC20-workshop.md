We are excited to announce the [Research Software Engineers in HPC Workshop
(RSE-HPC-2020)](https://us-rse.org/rse-hpc-2020/) to be held as part of [SC20](https://sc20.supercomputing.org/) (held virtually) this fall! This will be a half-day
workshop 10:00am-2:00pm EST, Thursday, November 12, 2020. It will feature keynote addresses from
Simon Hettrick and Frank Löffler, leaders in the RSE movements in the UK and Germany,
followed by talks and panel discussions on the needs of RSEs and RSE groups.

High Performance Computing (HPC), Computational Science and Engineering (CSE), and data
science rely on high-quality software, and the developers of this software are critical to the
impact of HPC, CSE, data science, and the larger scientific community. It is increasingly
recognized that such developers need a unique combination of skills: expertise in software
development together with a deep understanding of the scientific field for which the software is
being written. Recently, the term “Research Software Engineer” (RSE) has been applied to
people in such roles; this term originated in the UK in 2012, and has become widely recognized
worldwide over the past several years.

Although many research projects rely heavily on RSE contributions, formal recognition of the
unique RSE role is often lacking. Sometimes, these positions are pigeonholed into the existing
hierarchy of research positions, such as postdoctoral associates and research scientists in
academia, or analogous positions at other kinds of institutions, including at national labs and in
industry. However, this classification does not adequately describe RSE responsibilities, and
can cause problems for RSEs who seek career progression. This lack of a defined position and
career outlook leads many promising practitioners to abandon research altogether. In
response, many research institutions are creating specific positions and groups for RSEs, and
several national organizations of RSEs have formed.

In the HPC community in particular, software projects have historically required significant work
to develop specialized, highly performant software. This need has increased greatly in the past
few years, as projects have grappled with adapting their codes to new architectures such as
GPUs or many-core CPUs. Many projects have also had to address questions of correctness
and reproducibility. With all of these changes, the need has increased for skilled software
developers (RSEs) to write HPC software that is understandable, well-tested, maintainable, and
extensible. Even so, many of these RSEs still struggle to find positions and career recognition
in the modern research culture.

Because of all this, the time is right to hold a workshop for RSEs in the HPC community at this
year’s SC20 conference. This workshop will build on RSE panels and BOF sessions at earlier
SC conferences and other events, and on RSE conferences held in the UK and elsewhere.
Last year at SC19, for example, we discussed RSE roles and career paths in a BoF; we learned
that there was a large group interested in the topic, and that the term “RSE” was much better known than it was a couple of years earlier. This workshop will bring together RSEs and allies
involved in HPC, from all over the world, to grow the RSE community further by establishing and
strengthening professional networks of current RSEs and RSE leaders.
