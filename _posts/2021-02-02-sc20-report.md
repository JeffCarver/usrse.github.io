We were excited to hold the inaugural [Research Software Engineers in HPC
Workshop (RSE-HPC-2020)](https://us-rse.org/rse-hpc-2020/) as part of the
[SC20](https://sc20.supercomputing.org/) conference this year! The half-day,
virtual event featured 18 speakers and over 100 participants.

The opening session, chaired by Charles Ferenbaugh, began with keynote addresses
from Simon Hettrick in the UK and Frank LÃ¶ffler in Germany. They spoke on the
growth of the RSE movements in their respective countries. Though the name
"Research Software Engineer" is only about eight years old, the role is much
older. In those countries (and many others), when RSE events were first
organized, many RSEs joined in right away and communities grew quickly. Many who
joined said they were excited to have "found their people."

Following the keynotes, three speakers gave lightning talks on their RSE work in
various contexts: Miranda Mundt on how research software engineers can support
scientific software, Emilio Carcamo on the Research Software Engineering
ecosystem for scientific computing supported by SC3UIS in Colombia, and
Bernadette Boscoe on RSEs as maintainers and their role in keeping code alive.

We continued with two panel discussions; the first of these was on the topic of
building RSE teams and groups, chaired by Daniel S. Katz with Reed Milewicz,
Jeremy Cohen, Robert Sinkovits, Mahmood Shad, and Ben van Werkhoven.
Several panelists described RSE groups that have developed at their
institutions. In many cases the groups were informal at first, with
software developers coming together to interact across different
domains; later they grew into more formal groups with management
agreeing to provide support. Team-building within groups is an
important factor, happening both by technical means such as holding
group meetings and sharing knowledge, and by non-technical means such
as food and social events. Funding for groups is often a challenge.
Many groups run primarily on soft money, through short- and medium-term
projects; this can be effective at a large institution with many small
projects in flight, but carries more risk at smaller institutions. All
of the panelists were optimistic about the interesting work available
to RSEs, and their growing role in the research community.

The second panel, chaired by Sandra Gesing with Joanna Leng, Ian Cosden, Rinku
Gupta, and Carlos Maltzahn, discussed how to support RSE careers. Some
institutions have started to recognize RSE roles, but that recognition is uneven
across the research landscape. Many RSEs in academia and national labs leave for
industry; this makes retention a challenge, particularly since universities can
never compete on salary alone. Universities can, however, offer intangibles such
as job satisfaction, flexibility, and a creative community. Many RSEs struggle
to learn the skills they need for their work; some training programs and
resources exist, but often the learning path is ad hoc. Mentors and peers are a
great help for learning. Recognition for RSEs is sometimes difficult to gain;
more efforts are needed to convince PIs and administrators that software is
important. Even with the difficulties, the panelists agreed that the RSE career
is interesting and rewarding.

Overall the discussions were lively and many good questions were asked. We're
grateful to everyone who took part. Slides from some of the talks are available
on the [agenda page](https://us-rse.org/rse-hpc-2020/agenda/).
In addition, we are already making plans to (hopefully)
hold a second workshop this fall at [SC21](https://sc21.supercomputing.org/)
in St. Louis, MO (and/or perhaps virtually), and we hope that many of you will
be able to join us!
